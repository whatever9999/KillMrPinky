# KillMrPinky
Created by Dominique Russell (art and design) and Ethan Shellard (programming). This game is unfinished - the assets have all been created but code was unfinished. It was made for a university game jam.
The goal of the game is to point and click solve puzzles in a patient's dream (as a psychiatrist). In the dream you meet and interact with many different characters and collect items and complete tasks for them to discover what on earth is nagging your poor patient. WARNING: It may be pink and fluffy.
